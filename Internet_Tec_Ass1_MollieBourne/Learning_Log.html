I am going to be talking about what I have learnt and done during the lesson so that I am able to reflect and see what I have created though out the course this year so I am able to see how much I have progressed and learnt. I am also going to be talking about the thing that I could have improved on or asked for more help in the lesson so that I am able to keep and record of what I need to recap and go over and what I need to get help with. I am going to compile this information in to a table that is easy to read and look at below.</h4>

				<td>This is the first lesson of the year for “Internet Technology”, during this lesson we have been introduced to the course and the units that we are going to be looking at over the course of the year these 3 units were: HTML, CSS, and Java Script.  The HTML that we are going to be looking at is HTML 5 this is the newest version of HTML there is at the moment and we are going to be looking in to CSS3 as this is also the newest version. We also learnt that for this module there are 2 assessments that we need to complete. <br>

We then moved on to looking at HTML and what each person In the class new about HTML coding and whether we had used and created it before. For college I know how to create interfaces on Adobe Dreamweaver and I also knew how to edit HTML coding in this as well. I also know some limited basic coding which I have used to create a basic webpage in notepad, although I have not used HTML coding in a while. <br>

We then went on to look at what HTML stood for which is: Hyper Text Mark-up Language. This is used for the creation of websites and the creation of other information so that it is viewable in a web browser. We are currently on HTML 5 which is the newest and easiest version of html to use, it has been made easier so that people are able to get straight to the point of coding rather than having the spend lots of time setting up to HTML code in the program of their choice. The file extension for saving a HTML coding Script so that it opens in to a browser form is .HTML Or .HTM. <br>

We then moved on to look at different basic text editors that we are able to use so that to write and create code in for example for windows you are able to use: Notepad, Notepad++, Brackets, and WordPad, this are all use able but most of these will not work on an Apple Mac so we then also looked at some of the programs that we are able to use on a mac as well these being: Komodo Edit, And Brackets. We then moved on to looking at source code editors which are Notepad++ and Komodo Edit. <br>

We then had to go through and create a basic folder structure that we would be using throughout the course, we learnt that t is best not to use spaces because when uploading and setting the website up to work this can create problems so we have now been told to create spaces with the underscore ( _ ) instead so that we do not have problem in the future. <br>

Next we then stated recapping and learning the basics of HTML coding. We done this by opening a source editor of choice and recommendation of being simple and easy to use which was Notepad++. When recapping the basics of html coding we had to make sure that we save the Notepad++ Document as the correct file type otherwise the html code would not be read correctly and you would not be able to open the page in an internet browser.  <br>

Throughout the lesson I have learnt and recapped: the basic of creating HTML and using it to code websites, through the new Notepad++ which before I had not used as I had coded websites with in Adobe Dreamweaver and standard Notepad. Because of the new HTML 5 there are many things that you don’t have do when setting up a webpage no so some of the skills that we looked over and learnt and recapped were more basic and easier to preform than they had been in the past for example: Document type, which is now just DOCTYPE, other this that we looked at were:  title, heading, and body which then included, paragraphs, text headings, in different sizes for importance E.G. H1, H2, H3 etc., adding images, and adding hyperlinks, and then having these hyperlinks open with a new tab so that they main website is not lost when the user is looking at an external links this allows the users to have various different websites open at the same time so that they are able to flick  for site to site without losing what they were looking at previously. <br> 

Throughout the lesson I have also learnt about the different types of terminology used when coding in HTML. For example we learnt about Elements, Tags, and Attributes.  Were learnt what the Elements were, and that they contain Tags which then themselves contain Attributes, which add more information to the tags so that you are able to tell what they are doing and what is there, and what they have for example one would be a Source (SRC). <br> 
                    <p> Improvements: <br> Some of the things that I need to improve on for this lesson are that I need to remember that I need to close the html brackets so that the page and the commands that I have entre work correctly and fully. I also need to recap and go over some of the basic HTML commands that I have used before to refresh myself with especially the external links and hyperlinks. </p> </td>

				<td> This lesson we have recapped on what we learn from the first week going over the types of tags and attributes that we used to create our web-pages, we then went on to look at more tags, attributes and elements. We also looked at the W3C. <br>

The W3C – which is the World Wide Web Consortium, this is the committee that lays down the standard for websites and browsers so that websites work an all of the different web browsers, they tolerate some errors but we really need consistency across them all so the W3C lays down the rules and the standards each website needs to comply with to make this happen. This needs to happen because all web browsers interpret data in the form of HTML, CSS, and Java Script differently. And there for by having the W3C standards it makes the browsers comply with the interpretation specification. <br>
	
We then went on to looking at how we can validate HTML code which has to be done before the website can go live this is so that any errors are found so that they can be corrected and so that the website, will comply with W3C standards. The validation tool that we looked at was a validation service that is run by and offered by the W3C. This is the link for this validator: https://validator.w3.org/ . this is something that we have to get used to using as all of our HTML code now has to be validated and valid from now on, for each piece of work that we create we now need to run it through the validator. <br>

The new tags, and attributes that we have gone on to look at this lesson are or creating a table.  The table tag is &lt; table&gt; this tag holds the whole table with in it closing at the end with &lt;/table&gt;. This then contains row which are made up of &lt;tr&gt; elements, each row may contain a mixtures of &lt;th&gt; headings cell and &lt;td&gt; data cell tags, we then learnt that we were able to optionally add a caption to our table as well by using a &lt;caption&gt; tag.  After creating a basic table we were then taught how to put a border on this so that it was easier to read and see the layout of the table we done this in basic HTML code as we have not learnt how to do this in CSS yet. We then went on to looking at merging cells so that they are able to span across more than one column because our task was to create our University Timetable within a HTML document.  To merge cells we used a command called ‘colspan=”_”’ this went with in a &lt;tr&gt; tag so that it now looks like this &lt;tr colspan=”2”&gt; for an example of what I done.  I have then gone on to create my timetable in an html document. After completing this I have then had to create another HTML document and a table on this to create this work log in and transfer the information from last week’s lesson in to it. I have then carried on the write up about the lesson and what I have learnt in my logo which has now been converted in to a HTML document. <br>

We were also told that the assignment was unloaded to the portal so that we were able to have a look and possibly starting it.<br> 
                    <p>Improvements:<br> From this lesson I need to improve on getting the structures of table in the correct order to complete the HTML.</p></td>

				<td> This lesson we have looked over and recapped what we have done over the last two weeks with coding with HTML 5, we have then been looking at whether we have started the first Assignment (AE1) for this topic, this I have started in my own time, for this we then went on to looking at the complete file structure that we need to create for the assignment (AE1). <br>

We then started the actual lesson and we were looking at block elements and how they form separate blocks of HTML, each block element such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; can be contained within other block elements such as &lt;div&gt;.<br>

From looking a block elements we then started looking at inline elements. These are elements that stay in line with the rest of the content of the line for example: &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and &lt;abbr&gt; these are all elements that are in line with the text these elements are not able to go in to the body alone they need to be nested within a block or line of elements. <br>

We then went on to look at CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) we first learnt that we could change the styles of our text and website in 3 different ways that we could do singularly, or together, these can work together or separately and we learnt them in order of which would override the other command if it was different these were: inline style, internal style, and an external style. With CSS styling you are able to create a visually pleasing page for the eyes of the user and the audience, CSS styling allows you to be able to set up house styles and continuous styles that will work within many pages of just one website with that addition of a adding tags of “ID’s” and “Classes” so that you are able to have some text and DIV’s different colours from the standard Cascading Style Sheets. With CSS styling you are able to change the colour of the background text and Div boxes, you are able to change the style of text and the layout of the page. <br>

We then started with looking at an inline style this is a style that would have been used to create different fonts and sizes for each text command in HTML before CSS was introduced this style is created with in the HTML text body itself where the paragraph tag is for example it would look like this for an inline style: &lt;p style = “color: red&gt; this style is the most direct type of styling a webpage. The next type of styling is an internal styling sheet this styling sheet sits near the top of the page in the head in a section of brackets that are &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; this is for when you want a unique style for that page. The last type of styling is external styling this is where you create a new document and then link the style sheet with in the &lt;head&gt; as a link. This is so that you are able to have a style that can be applied to many different pages. When creating an external style sheet you often need to use “ID’s” and “classes” to help brake the page down in to different sections so that you are able to style things differently and easier. An id specifies one element and then is used with a # to symbolise it on the CSS Style Sheet, and a class is a more generalised term so that you can have more than one element with the same class this is symbolised with a (.) dot in the CSS style sheet. These are both different types of selectors and they help with being able to spilt elements up with in the HTML code to style with CSS.<br>
                    <p> Improvements:<br> From this lesson there are a few things that I need to improve on they things are I need to practise linking the style sheet to my webpages and getting them to link correctly without using an absolute file path. I also need to improve on the layout of setting up a clear CSS style Sheet. </p></td>

				<td> This lesson we have recapped on the CSS that we learnt last week along with the HTML that we have learn over the last 3 weeks as well. We recapped all of the CSS elements that we looked at such as: inline, internal and external styles. We then went over the layout and the ways of styling our text and web pages with different elements such as: underline, font size, font colours, div colour, and alignment as well as a few others. <br>

We then went on to looking a new elements, attributes, properties, and values: these were: margins, padding, colours specifiers, and measurements. We looked at how padding works with in a div box so that the text doesn’t sit right up against the top left hand side of the div so that it is more readable and so it looks more professional, we then went on to look at how margins work so that the div boxes don’t sit next to each other or anything on the outside of the div boxes so that there is a gap around the outside of the box and the other content.  We then looked at how we are able to apply different colours to the page in different ways such as: Hexadecimal, decimals intensities, and percentage intensities, these worked in different ways to create colours and mixes. <br>

We then went on to look at CSS Pseudo elements which work as properties and values. These help style different element with in the web pages and the text. We then went on to look a Pseudo Classes; these are so that you are able to add effects to the state of an element for example is you had an A element you are able to change the state of the element so that when you “Hover” it changes colour or size and the same for when its “active”, “Focused”, and “Visited”.<br>

We then went on to look at basic page layout with block and inline styles. We looked at how you are able to use CSS to move boxes by floating them to the left, right, or on top of each other, we also looked at position properties, such as: static – default value, i.e. elements are laid out in the normal flow, relative – an element is moved relative to its place in the normal flow according to its top and left values, absolute – an element is taken completely out of the flow and then positioned with respect to the top and left of the first element that contains it. Used for sticky footers, try to avoid in any other case, and fixed – an element remains exactly where it is when the page is scrolled.  This then lead on to positioning schemes, normal flow is when block elements begin new block and inline elements laid out in line within their containing block element, this is for elements with a static or relative position property. Floating is when element is shifted to the left or right within its current line until reaches the edge of its containing block. Absolute positioning is when elements having a position property value of absolute or fixed are absolutely positioned, this is something we are told to avoid. <br>

                    <p>Improvements:<br>From this lesson I need to look at and revisit floating and positioning div boxes. </p></td>

				<td> This lesson I have had a catch up week in which we have also looked back over the W3Schools HTML validator to make sure that all of our pages have correct code, we have then recapped over some of the basic mistakes that some people are making for example using spaces when naming files and folders, not to use absolute file paths because they cause issues, and when linking to use a forward slash/ rather than a backslash \. We were also reminded to use indentation to section off the html code.<br>

<p>Improvements: <br> There I nothing that I really need to improve on but I need to finish running my code through the validator.</p></td>

				<td> This lesson we have looked at how to create a navigation bar from a list, you are able to create both a vertical and a horizontal navigation bar that can span across the page. To create these list you then need to take the away the general formatting for a list which you would do by creating a style and then using the commands: list-style: none for a vertical list and you would do the same for horizontal but you would need to add an extra step so it would be: list-style: none, and display: inline. <br>
We then went on to look at radius and gradients, you are able to create a colour gradient using // background: linear-gradient (black, white) and this then gives you a colour gradient going from one colour to another.  We also then looked at a border radius and this means that you are able to change the DIV from Sharpe pointed corners to rounded corners this works to make the boxes more aesthetically pleasing to the eye of the viewer. <br>
We then went on to looking at semantic elements with html5 you are able to have semantic tags which are the same in theory as a div box but rather than having a div looking like this &lt;div id = “header”&gt; you just have a tag like this &lt;header&gt; this makes it easier to use and see within you code and it also allows you to create the same functions that you can do to a div box but to a header box.  Semantic element examples are: &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav> &lt;section&gt; &lt;aside&gt; &lt;article&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, these are all example of semantic tags that you are able to use in your code. <br>
From this I then went on to download the task for the lesson and we then had to download the task from “MyCourse” and then extract the work from the zip file and then save it in the correct folder we then had to open both the html text format and the CSSS style sheet in notepad++ we then had to follow the instructions to change and improve the style and the layout of the page this was the first task, for this we were given a before and after image and we had to create the second image by changing the Style Sheets.  After completing this task I then moved on to the second task. <br>
The second task for this lesson was to create a second Nav bar on the page but this time it needed to be horizontal across the page. I have then created a second nav bar and this goes across the page horizontally under the header. <br>
After completing the second task I then moved on to the 3rd task which was to then use 2 other CSS3 properties and to use them within the page. We then had a link that we were able to follow which was: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/10-css3-properties-you-need-to-be-familiar-with--net-16417 this link then took us to a page with new CSS3 properties on that we were then able to use and we then had to pick 2 of these to use on our page.  From this page I have then chosen 2 different CSS properties, these were a div box shadow, and a text shadow I have added these to this page. <br>

<p>Improvements:<br>I need to improve on adding nav bar properties to my webpage.</p></td>

				<td> This lesson we have looked at the file transfer protocol so that we can look at uploading our Assessment on the the server, we then went on to look at how we can create forms and form elements. We looked at the types of different forms that we can create and the types of inputs that we can have, such as drop down menus, radio buttons, text field boxes, check boxes, text areas and submit buttons. All of these elements need to be inputted in a correct way so that they work correctly. We first looked at the &lt;form&gt; &lt;/form&gt; tags and and then what would go in these tags I have mentioned these already, but the tags look like this in a full line of code, for example: &lt;input type=“radio” name=”rating” value=”Excellent”&gt; Excellent&lt;br&gt;, this is an example of just one of the input tags that I have looked at. We also looked at the &lt;label&gt; &lt;/label&gt; tag so that we can give the input type a label/heading. <br>
After looking at all of these elements we then went on to looking at how we can get HTML 5 to instruct the website browser that we are using to validate the form before it is sent to the server. <br>
After looking at each element I then went on to complete the task for this lesson and this was to created a file and paste in the source code that we were given to complete for this lessons task. We had to complete the form using all of the tags and inputs that we have looed at throughout the lesson and in the lesson notes so that the form looked like the image that we were given, after completing this task we then this week did not need to validate the form that we created and finished as we did not use any html. <br>
                        <p>Improvements:<br>I do not feel that I need to improve on anything from this lesson other than some more gernal practise on creating forms. </p></td>

				<td>This lesson we have been looking at how you are able layout forms correctly so that they are presentable and usable. It is important to design a usable and accessible form that suites all those would may fill in the form, because it means that more people will be able to fill the forms out easily and quickly, with out getting confused, you would get more customers and therefore you could make more money, and accessible forms lead to a better overall user experience. <br>

Form here we have learnt what the &lt;legend&gt; and field set tags do and how to use them with in our forms. These tags allow you to select a group of data and encase in within a box with a heading in the outline of the box these work well to divide and layout forms in a readable to user friendly way. We were then shown a Wireframe Mock Up of a form and how it should look and work.<br>

This lesson the task we have been given the task to structure a successful user friendly form, first we downloaded the task and then create the file necessary to download the code that was given and save as a html document, we then had to layout the form in the correct way using &lt;p&gt; tags to divided inputs and labels in to related lines, &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;Legend&gt; tags to group together common inputs, we had to makes sure everything was lined up correctly and to style the submit button, I also style the form as I worked through creating a CSS style sheet and linking this to my form and then I as used HTML 5 validation with the :invalid and :valid pseudo lass so that users know if the input is valid in each box. <br>

After finishing the task, I then made sure to validate both my HTML and my CSS with the W3Schools Validator, and made any corrections that I needed to. <br>

                    <p>Improvements: <br> From this lesson I need to improve on Styling forms and read more in to doing this I also need to re go over HTML5 validation for the user. </p></td>
