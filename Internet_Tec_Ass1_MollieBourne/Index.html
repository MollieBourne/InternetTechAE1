            <p>My name is Mollie Bourne and I am studying web design and development at Solent University, I am in my first year of the course and I belong to the school of Media Arts and technology, one of my unit for this course is “Internet Technology” this unit is all about learning how to use html and CSS to create websites, I have studied this before in small amounts but have previously used other programmes that are more front end design like Adobe Dreamweaver. I am very much a designer rather than knowing loads about html and CSS but I am enjoying learning how to do both and creating websites with code and HTML just as much as I enjoy the design side.  </p>

				<p> Internet technology is one unit within my Web-design And Development course, in this unit we learn how to code websites, with HTML 5, CSS, and Java Script. With this unit we have been learning new skill each week and learning how to create a working and effective website, with each week we are given a new task to do which helps us learn and create websites. This unit consists of two assignments each worth 50% each of the total grade. This page is part of the first Assignment for this unit. For the first assignment of this unit I have only used HTML 5 and CSS, as this is what we have learnt from the unit so far, and therefore these are the skills and techniques I have used to create this assignment. </p>
